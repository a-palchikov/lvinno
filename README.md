======

Helpers to use native listview controls in Inno Setup.

Additional dependencies:
 * InnoCallback (http://www.sherlocksoftware.org/page.php?id=54)

   Used to implement window procedure directly in Inno. If you don't need this dependency, you'll have to 
   reimplement the window procedure in your own library.
   
For usage examples see dummy.isd.
